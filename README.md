# Hello-World-Source-Code
This is source code for a test of C++ (exe file not included.)
To compile it, you have to have the following: Visual Studio Community 2017 or later and a 64-bit computer (why wouldn't you have a 64-bit computer?)

Download and install Visual Studio Community 2017 or later. After it's done installing, unzip the folder and open the .sln. Go to the main.cpp file and a code window will appear. Go to Build > Build Solution. This takes at least a couple of seconds. And ta-da! The exe is built.
